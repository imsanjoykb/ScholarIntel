Observations of the baryon to dark matter fraction in galaxies through cosmic time are a fundamental test for galaxy formation models. Recent observational studies have suggested that some disk galaxies at $z>1$ host declining rotation curves, in contrast with observations of low redshift disk galaxies where stellar or HI rotation curves flatten at large radii. We present an observational counterexample, a galaxy named DSFG850.95 at $z=1.555$ (4.1 Gyr after the big bang) that hosts a flat rotation curve between radii of $sim$6--14 kpc (1.2--2.8 disk scale lengths) and has a dark matter fraction of $0.44pm0.08$ at the H-band half light radius, similar to the Milky Way. We create position-velocity and position-dispersion diagrams using Keck/MOSFIRE spectroscopic observations of H$alpha$ and [NII] emission features, which reveal a flat rotation velocity of $V_{rm flat}=285pm12$ km/s and an ionized gas velocity dispersion of $sigma_{0}=48pm4$ km/s. This galaxy has a rotation-dominated velocity field with $V_{rm flat}/sigma_{0}sim6$. Ground-based H-band imaging reveals a disk with S'ersic index of $1.29pm0.03$, an edge-on inclination angle of $87pm2^{circ}$, and an H-band half light radius of $8.4pm0.1$ kpc. Our results point to DSFG850.95 being a massive, rotationally-supported disk galaxy with a high dark-matter-to-baryon fraction in the outer galaxy, similar to disk galaxies at low redshift.
